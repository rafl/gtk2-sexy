NAME
    Gtk2::Sexy - Perl interface to the sexy widget collection

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows a perl developer to access the widgets of the sexy
    widget collection, which currently includes the following widgets:

    SexyIconEntry
      SexyIconEntry is a GtkEntry with support for inline icons. They can
      appear on either side of the entry or on both sides. There's also
      built-in support for adding a clear button for clearing the entry.
      This widget is particularly useful as search fields.

    SexySpellEntry
      SexySpellEntry is a GtkEntry with inline spell checking. This makes
      use of Enchant and allows the user to see what they've typed wrong as
      they type it. A right-click menu is provided for misspelled words
      offering suggestions.

    SexyUrlLabel
      SexyUrlLabel is a GtkLabel with support for embedded hyperlinks. It
      uses a modified form of the Pango markup format that supports the

        <a href="...">...</a>

      tag. The hyperlink will appear in blue and can be activated by
      clicking it. Right-clicking the hyperlink displays a menu offering the
      ability to activate it or to copy the URL.
